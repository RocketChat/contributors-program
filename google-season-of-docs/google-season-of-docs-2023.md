[![Google Season of Docs 2019](https://github.com/Sing-Li/bbug/raw/master/images/gsodlogo.png)](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/)

[Google Season of Docs](https://g.co/seasonofdocs) provides support for open source projects to improve their documentation and gives professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source. Together we raise awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.

Projects can cover a wide range of fields including Cloud computing, operating systems, graphics, medicine, programming languages, robotics, science, security and many more. Season of Docs is not a recruiting program or an internship but it does provide invaluable experience and looks great on a resume!

## Rocket.Chat Developer Documentation Re-write

### The Problem

Under Rocket.Chat org we have multiple open source projects, e.g. our Electron based multi-platform desktop client, our cross platform React Native mobile client, Omnichannel, TypeScript/JavaScript SDK, Golang SDK, extensible snap package, a group of DevOps focused projects that ease our deployment pipeline across multiple platforms, and more.

Currently the documentation on getting them started with a development environment is fragmented. Developers need to spend time on basic setup rather than coding, and it is frustrating for new users. We have noticed a series of setbacks from contributors getting started with setting up their development environments for different projects and following the initial steps required to be able to start contributing quickly and effectively. We have a number of open questions across our community server and public GitHub repositories.

It is also worth noting we are also missing documentations for projects that a lot of contributors are getting invested in nowadays (DevOps related).&#x20;

There have been failed attempts at re-organizing the structure for better intuitive navigation and easy to consume content for beginner and experienced members of the community. Noting our developer documentation contains \[or should contain] contents for more than one contributable open source project.

**Existing documentation page:** [https://developer.rocket.chat](https://developer.rocket.chat)

### Scope

A bird's eye view of the project scope would look something like

* Building a new structure that may or may not be extensible
  * Considering current structure and pain points
  * Understanding our large number of public projects
* Repository structure
* Components guide
* Quick onboarding guide for all platforms
* Troubleshooting
* Contribution guideline
* Project specific architecture speaded structure, like core microservices

Writers are free to suggest alternative approaches and/or ideas as long as they are aligned with the goal of intuitive and friendly contribution path for developers.

**Out of scope**

Project features unrelated to developers/contributors are outside of the scope of this project.

### How would we measure success?

* Reduction in github issues related to contributor onboarding and environment setup issues
* Reduction in number of open questions found in our public community server (a large portion being driven in via Google Summer of Code)
* Increase in pull request numbers to core and non-core projects
* Increased coverage of well known contributor pain points

### What skills would a technical writer need to work on this project?

**Must have:** Demonstrated experience working with large and complex structured docs for developers. Experience with text markup tools, revisions control tools, and documentation processing workflows/pipelines. Basic technical understanding of modern web and CS concepts.

**Nice to have:** Experience with automation, and DevOps concepts and tools like docker, kubernetes. Ability to read code are nice to have but not must.
