# Annual Contribution Programs

Welcome to Rocket.Chat contribution programs! This repository houses information about all Rocket.Chat annual contributors program.

Whether you're a developer, designer, writer, or just someone passionate about open source, Rocket.Chat participates in annual contribution programs, and we welcome your contributions to our project.

Rocket.Chat is an open-source team chat and collaboration platform that has grown rapidly in popularity. Thanks to our community of contributors who have helped us develop new features, fix bugs, and improve the user experience.

The annual contribution programs provide an opportunity to get involved with the Rocket.Chat ecosystem and Rocket.Chat projects. These programs include:

* [**Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**](google-summer-of-code/): An annual program that allows university students to work on open-source projects over the summer.
* [**Google Season of**](google-season-of-docs/) [ **Docs (GSoD)**](google-season-of-docs/): An annual program that allows technical writers to work on open-source projects and improve their documentation and gain experience.

Each program has unique requirements and benefits, but all offer a chance to learn new skills, work with experienced mentors, and make a meaningful contribution to the open-source world.

Open source is about collaboration and community; we're excited to have you join us.
